## Overview

### The challenge

This FEM challenge is to build out a blog preview card as per Figma design and other style specifications.

By completing this challenge, I have demonstrated my ability to:
- Execute a task based on Figma designs
- Create a mobile-first responsive design experience, including a desktop breakpoint
- Develop a card-based component using Flexbox for unidirectional content elements
- Create hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

- Best practices for using Google fonts (link tag vs. @import) and deferred loading
- Committing and versioning using Git -> Github

### Continued development

After this project, I wish to continue learning more about:

- Responsive development
- Git best practices

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow: Including Google Fonts link or import?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12316501/including-google-fonts-link-or-import) - This helped understand the advantages of loading fonts via link tag vs. @import to avoid deferred loading or font flash.
